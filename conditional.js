/*Word Problem: Exam Grader

Suppose you are a teacher, and you want to grade your students based on their exam scores. The maximum score for the exam is 100. Each student needs a minimum score of 60 to pass the exam. If a student scores above 90, they receive an "A" grade. If their score is between 80 and 90 (inclusive), they get a "B" grade. If their score is between 70 and 80 (inclusive), they receive a "C" grade. If their score is between 60 and 70 (inclusive), they get a "D" grade. Anything below 60 results in an "F" grade.
Additionally, if a student scores above 95, they are eligible for extra credit. Extra credit is 5 points added to their final score.
Write a TypeScript program to take the student's score as input and output their grade and whether they are eligible for extra credit.
